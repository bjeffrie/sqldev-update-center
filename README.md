An update center for SQL developer public open source extensions found at the https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper repository.

NOTE: This site may also include extension examples from the local https://github.com/bjeffrie/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper repository.

You can add https://cdn.rawgit.com/bjeffrie/sqldev-update-center/master/update-center.xml
as an update center in SQL Developer or download this repository and use the install from local file option.
