# sqldev-update-center

***** 
This site is provided by me as an example of an update center and a public service to host the example extensions. It is not provided or supported by Oracle. 
*****

An update center for SQL developer public open source extensions found at the [oracle/oracle-db-examples/sqldeveloper](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper) repository.

NOTE: This site may also include extension examples from the local [bjeffrie/oracle-db-examples/sqldeveloper](https://github.com/bjeffrie/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper) repository.

You can add [https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/bjeffrie/sqldev-update-center/master/update-center.xml](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/bjeffrie/sqldev-update-center/master/update-center.xml)
as an update center in SQL Developer or download this repository and use the install from local file option. This is having intermittent issues. An alternate update center URL is  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjeffrie/sqldev-update-center/master/update-center.xml
