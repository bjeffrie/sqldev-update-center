# sqldev-update-center

***** 
This site is provided by me as an example of an update center and a public service to host the example extensions. It is not provided or supported by Oracle. 
*****

An update center for SQL developer public open source extensions found at the [oracle/oracle-db-examples/sqldeveloper](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper) repository.

NOTE: This site may also include extension examples from the local [bjeffrie/oracle-db-examples/sqldeveloper](https://github.com/bjeffrie/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/sqldeveloper) repository.

You can add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjeffrie/sqldev-update-center/master/update-center.xml
as an update center in SQL Developer or download this repository and use the install from local file option. 

* 2020/08/26: Added ConnectionHelper example

* 2020/09/01: Remove cdn URL masking. We do not need content-type & direct (raw) access works fine.
